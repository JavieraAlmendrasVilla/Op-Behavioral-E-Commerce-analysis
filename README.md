# Operational & Behavioral Analysis

This project demonstrates how **data-driven customer segmentation** can be used to uncover actionable insights that improve **marketing strategy, customer retention, and revenue growth**.

I applied **machine learning (K-Means clustering)** and **behavioral analytics (RFM segmentation)** to identify meaningful differences between high-value and low-value customers, then quantified those differences with business-relevant KPIs.

## 📊 Project Summary

**Business Question**

> How do purchasing behaviors differ between customer segments, and how can these insights inform **personalized marketing strategies**?

**Approach**

* **Segmented customers** into groups such as **VIP, Middle Class, and Inactive** using RFM metrics and clustering.
* **Engineered behavioral features** (frequency, basket size, product preference, seasonality, return rate).
* **Visualized trends** to show how customer value and behavior differ by segment, geography, and time.

## 🛠️ What I Did

* Built **data pipelines** to clean and preprocess raw retail data (\~500K transactions).
* Designed **segmentation framework** combining RFM scores and clustering.
* Conducted **behavioral analysis** across KPIs: purchase frequency, basket size, returns, and seasonality.
* Developed **visual dashboards and plots** to communicate insights effectively.

## 🔑 Key Insights

* **Inactive customers**: Despite having the **highest average basket size**, they also show the **highest return rate**, signaling a need for better product fit or post-purchase engagement.
* **Peak purchasing time**: **Sundays around midday** are the busiest, suggesting targeted weekend promotions could maximize conversions.
* **Geographic trends**:
  * **Scandinavian countries** have the **highest VIP customer rate**, representing strong markets for loyalty programs.
  * **European countries** overall show the highest proportion of **Middle-Class customers**, ideal for upselling and seasonal promotions.
  * **Non-European countries** have disproportionately high rates of **Inactive customers**, indicating potential challenges in international customer retention.

These findings give clear levers for **personalized marketing strategies**, such as retention campaigns for inactive customers, weekend flash sales, and geography-specific loyalty initiatives.
